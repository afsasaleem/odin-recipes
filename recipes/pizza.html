   </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
    <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>Pizza sauce</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Your choice of pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>         
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Your Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as recommended on your pizza dough packaging. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Pizza Dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness. If you're using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet dusted with cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Add Pizza Sauce: Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Add Cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. For extra flavor, you can also add some grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Add Toppings: Add your favorite pizza toppings. Get creative! Whether you like classic pepperoni, fresh veggies, or a combination of both, this is where you can make your pizza unique.</li>
        <li>Bake the Pizza: If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza from the pizza peel onto the hot stone in the oven. Otherwise, place the baking sheet with the pizza into the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake Until Golden and Bubbly: Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from Oven: Using oven mitts or a pizza peel, carefully remove the pizza from the oven.</li>
        <li>Add Finishing Touches: Optionally, drizzle some olive oil over the hot pizza and sprinkle Italian seasoning or red pepper flakes for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Slice and Serve: Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two, then slice it into pieces and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
    </ol>
