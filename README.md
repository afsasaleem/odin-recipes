# odin-recipes
Odin first recipe project.
Welcome to my Odin Recipes project! This is a simple project where I'll be creating a website that showcases various recipes. Through this project, I will demonstrate my ability to:

- Create a basic HTML structure
- Link different web pages together
- Embed images and format text in HTML
- Use Git and GitHub for version control

Stay tuned as I add delicious recipes and build out this project!
